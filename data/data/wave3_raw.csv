For example, the question about the population size of the USA, while I didn't know the exact number, I already knew it had to be at least close to 350 million. Other questions, I had no idea about, like the Scorpio zodiac sign and happiness, so I tried to pick a reasonable middle. ","I tried to pair it with my educated guess and what seemed reasonable. If I use the previous example above, I don't ever remember the USA having over 350 million people, so when the news told me that the number was less, I believed that to be more likely true than false. For other answers, like the zodiac sign, of which I had no idea, I just followed my own personal bias with my sign. 


When it came to the very end on my pick on what other people thought news was true or false, I figured with human nature and people would more likely believe news to be true if it aligned more with their beliefs, such as politics. I think it has to do with deep bias built into us and that people like seeing their own thoughts affirmed rather than challenged and contradicted.

For example, for the U.S. population, I recalled it was a bit over 330 million in recent years, so I guessed slightly above that to account for growth.","When deciding which source was more likely to be True News versus False News, I focused on comparing the news message to my own prior knowledge or reasonable expectations about the correct answer. For example, if the news said ‚Äúthe answer is greater than your guess,‚Äù I considered whether that statement made sense given what I knew or had just guessed.

If the news message aligned well with what I believed to be accurate or plausible, I rated it as more likely True News. Conversely, if the news message contradicted what seemed logical or factual based on my knowledge, I judged it as more likely False News. Overall, my strategy was to assess the consistency of the news with my own reasonable estimate and choose the likelihood accordingly, aiming to maximize my points by being as accurate as possible in distinguishing truthful from false news.

When making my initial guesses, I tried to rely on a combination of what I already knew or could reasonably estimate, along with general knowledge and logic. For example:
	‚Ä¢	For the U.S. population question, I thought about recent census data and typical population growth rates, which helped me estimate a number close to current official estimates.
	‚Ä¢	For questions related to happiness or subjective measures, I considered national averages and whether there might be any notable differences for specific groups, but I kept my guesses close to the average since I had no strong evidence otherwise.
	‚Ä¢	For geographic questions like the latitude of the U.S. center, I drew on what I remembered about U.S. geography and known locations.
	‚Ä¢	When I received news messages, I assessed their credibility based on how plausible the claim was compared to my initial guess and general knowledge.
	‚Ä¢	For questions involving beliefs about news trust, I considered human psychology‚Äîlike people‚Äôs tendency to trust information that aligns with their hopes or political views.

Overall, I tried to be honest and reasonable with each guess, balancing what I knew with uncertainty where appropriate.","

When deciding whether a news source was more likely True News or False News, I focused mainly on how consistent the message was with what I knew or logically expected about the question. For example:
	‚Ä¢	If the news said the answer was greater or less than my guess, I checked whether that made sense given my initial estimate and general knowledge. If it contradicted obvious facts or seemed unlikely, I leaned toward it being False News.
	‚Ä¢	I also considered whether the news message fit with typical patterns or reasonable trends. For example, if my guess was already near a well-known benchmark (like the geographic center of the U.S.), I was skeptical of news claiming it was far off.
	‚Ä¢	Sometimes, the news message challenged my guess but still felt plausible, so I gave some chance it could be True News.
	‚Ä¢	I tried to avoid letting my personal biases overly influence my judgment and focused on the internal logic and consistency.

For example, for the question about population I tried to remember the specific numbers I recall seeing, which ended up being a few different possible numbers, so then I tried to think about which I may have seen more recently; for the population guess, it reminded me of recent discussion in the news about people like JD Vance talking about how he feels that the United States should make efforts to increase the population. And while the details about the current population of the US were still quite murky and hard to remember, I did try to think about any context like that where I would have likely seen the current population numbers. This was still not super helpful (I tend to have trouble recalling specific details from memory, which leads me to second guess my memory often), but thinking about news stories (and some science content that I recall from a few years back on the topic) did help me determine if I was at least (I think) somewhat close. ","This was unexpectedly difficult compared to what I was expecting. It was mostly a guess, but I did attempt to make similar associations in my memory as i did for the initial guess. Using the question about the current population as an example: For the population, the (true OR false) news stated it was greater than my guess from the previous page - so I thought about my guess in two different ways. First I thought about the number I guessed, and assumed it was ""True"" news; next I thought about the same number, but while assuming it was ""False"" news. And then after doing that, it was mostly just a ""gut"" reaction for which one ""felt"" more correct. So I used that gut feeling while making my guess for whether I thought it was true or fake news (and to what extent). I am still a bit unsure of my answers, but after forcing myself to think about my guess from two different perspectives did help me feel a little bit more confident for answering the second part.",Neither agree nor disagree,Strongly disagree,Strongly disagree,Fairly unhappy,apple,0.591,1182.421,1188.791,14,That the answer was further in the direction of their political party than they initially believed,That the world was a worse place than they initially believed,That they performed better on this task than they initially believed,,67382e41c232d1004b052fc4,683b153805393e0fba20ff8a,683b33fc598fea30b10cb5b3,4,46.12,42.86,43.7,45.64,44.35,46.07,47.34,41.94,45.31,46.6,49.32,46.88,greater than,greater than,greater than,less than,$50 ,$5 ,10,,,4,1

As for assessing the true news sources and the false news sources, I had a better sense of which sources might be true and which were not regardless as to whether or not it confirmed my answer. Now for instance the US population I'm pretty certain is not less than 315 million and so I assessed the news source accordingly as ""false"" when it said that this number was smaller. In other words, I wasn't looking for affirmation from a news source, as I was perfectly willing to be incorrect in my answers. ","I determined that based on whether or not I thought that it was likely that the answer was correct. For instance, as I mentioned above -- I was pretty sure that the U.S. population was not less than 315 million and so I considered it False News when I saw that it said it was less than that number. That example is the most salient one right now because that one seemed most obviously false.

So, I chose 333 million as a reasonable ‚Äúmedian‚Äù estimate that seemed to me to be most likely.
In Round 2, there is no data that suggested the general population of Sagittarians differed from the overall population for life-satisfaction. Since 45.5% of all adults were ‚Äúcompletely/very happy,‚Äù Astrological sign couldn‚Äôt make that much difference, and 45.5% is what I expected.
In Round 3, I recalled that the U.S. National Geodetic Survey puts it at approximately 39¬∞ 50‚Ä≤ N, and that would be roughly 39.83¬∞ N: So, I rounded off to 39.8.
","For Round 1, since I estimated the actual population to be roughly 334 million, ""less than 333"" must be false. So, with extremely high confidence, I predicted the message to be from False News (picked 0/10 True, 10/10 False).
For Round 2, I was equally uncertain if the rate for Sagittarius is above or below 45.5 %. As my prior assumption lay in equal chances of a Sagittarius ‚Äúcompletely/very happy‚Äù rate being above or below 45.5 %, seeing ‚Äúbelow 45.5‚Äù is equally as likely to be a truth as a lie.

There's no real strategy when it comes to me. When it comes to guessing, I go with my gut instincts in choosing a direction, but with simple logic. I'll explain. About the population, I live in a big city and it's not even the biggest in the state. So, in my city there's like around 3 million people living here. Also the consensus they take every year, I always feel the numbers are inaccurate due to illegal immigrants and citizens being counted multiple times. I was once put on the consensus 3 different times in the same week. Once at my apartment. Once when I was at my parent's home. Once when I was over at a friend's house. So, based on that, I assume the numbers will always be higher. I estimated between  200 and 400 million and took the median 300 as my answer. Hope that made sense. It did in my head, until I reread it, but that's how my brain works.

Truly happy Scorpios are a rare find, I basically used the average population you provided. I figure there's more mysterious and dark Scorpios out there, but even among those there are still some happy scattered in there. Using the 45.5% and 54.4% avg and guessed 10% of  the average are Scorpios. I guessed roughly 4% were happy scorpios.","The news is tricky. I'll be honest. I don't trust the news or social media. I'm not a jump on the bandwagon type. I prefer to look things up and determine for myself if there's any truth or validity to any claims. Even that information can either be minimal but factual, verbose and false, or either can have mixed half-truth and half-false. Also, people who lie will most always try to steer you away from finding out everything or lie in plain sight hoping that will be enough to steer you away.  So, I just went with my gut. In the beginning of the study you mentioned and emphasized there was not trickery going on, so I assumed you would try to steer me away from the bonus. I'm not saying that's what you did. I'm saying, I used that as a position to help guide my instincts.
